# DJ Profiles

This is a project to collect profiles of DJs between 1989 and 1998.

# Introduction

An idea has been floated for the sydneyravehistory.com website to have a list of DJs with profiles, pictures, personal web links, mixtapes, raves, flyers & etc.

In order to complete this task we are asking the community to help out by filling in DJ profiles.

In this repository is the DJTemplate:

```json
{
    "real_name": "",
    "discogs": "",
    "wikipedia": "",
    "profile_pic": "",
    "srh_raves": "search?query=DJName",
    "srh_mixtapes": "mixtapes#DJInitial",
    "srh_interview": "Leave for SRH",
    "srh_flyers": "Leave for SRH",
    "profile": {
        "description": "",
        "sites": [
            "",
            ""
        ]
    },
    "aliases": [
        "",
        ""
    ]
}

# Instructions

Make copies of this file for each DJ and use DJ SPellbound.json as an example.
