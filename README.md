# Introduction

For the sydneyravehistory.com website, the idea has been floated to have a list of DJs with profiles, pictures, personal web links, mixtapes, raves & flyers.

In order to complete this task, we are asking the community to help out by filling in DJ profiles.

In this repository is the DJTemplate:

```json
{  
    "real_name": "",  
    "discogs": "",  
    "wikipedia": "",  
    "profile_pic": "",  
    "srh_raves": "search?query=DJName",  
    "srh_mixtapes": "mixtapes#DJInitial",  
    "srh_interview": "Leave for SRH",  
    "srh_flyers": "Leave for SRH",  
    "profile": {  
      "description": "",  
      "sites": [  
        "",  
        ""  
      ]  
    },  
    "aliases": [  
      "",  
      ""  
    ]  
}

Make copies of this file for each DJ and use DJ SPellbound.json as an example.

Thanks SRH Admin!
