For the sydneyravehistory.com website the idea has been floated to have a list of DJs with profile, pic, personal web links, mixtapes, raves & flyers.

In order to complete this task we are asking the community to help out filling in DJ Profiles.

In this repository is the DJTemplate:

`{
    "real_name": "",
    "discogs": "",
    "wikipedia": "",
    "profile_pic": "",
    "srh_raves": "search?query=DJName",
    "srh_mixtapes": "mixtapes#DJInitial",
    "srh_interview": "Leave for SRH",
    "srh_flyers": "Leave for SRH",
    "profile": {
      "description": "",
      "sites": [
        "",
		""
      ]
    },
    "aliases": [
      "",
	  ""
    ]
  }`

Make copies of this file for each DJ and use DJ SPellbound.json as an example. Thanks SRH Admin!
