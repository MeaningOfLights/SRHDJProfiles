      "description": "DJ/Producer Luke Spellbound from Sydney Australia has a dance music career spanning over 15 years. After DJing for many years, he teamed up with Mikey Leadbetter in 1995 to form Bopgun. They released 8 EP's on Cen•Cor Records, including tracks with artists DJ Slipmatt and also MC Bee. In 1997, the duo started Execution Records, collaborating with Australian artists DJ Jen-E from Brisbane and Luke Kenny (aka The Berzerker - ISR/DJ Devious - ID&T) from Melbourne and released another 4 EP's, including the hardcore anthem of 1998 “WannaFUK”. After years of pioneering hardcore in his home country, and a year living and DJing in Canada, Luke Spellbound emerged with his fresh new sound – Hardstyle. In a move to take his unique hardstyle sound from Australia to the international scene, 2004 saw Spellbound signing up with Hardnation Records in Germany along with Mikey The Mad Kiwi, and since then releasing five successful EP's. The duo have made their mark in Holland with releases on DJS Records and the newly formed Special Records in 2006.",
